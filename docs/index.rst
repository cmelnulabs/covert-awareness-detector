Covert Awareness Detector Documentation
========================================

Welcome to the Covert Awareness Detector documentation. This project implements 
deep learning models to detect hidden consciousness in patients who appear 
behaviorally unresponsive but show neural signatures of awareness.

**Building on Research by Huang et al. (University of Michigan)**

This is a Python machine learning implementation inspired by the groundbreaking 
neuroscience research of Huang, Hudetz, Mashour et al., who identified covert 
consciousness signatures in fMRI data during propofol anesthesia.
