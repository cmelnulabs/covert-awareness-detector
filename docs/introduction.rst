What is Covert Consciousness?
==============================

**Covert consciousness** (also called *covert awareness* or *hidden consciousness*) is the presence of subjective experience in the absence of behavioral response (Huang et al., 2026).

   Huang, Z., Tarnal, V., Fotiadis, P., Vlisides, P. E., Janke, E. L., Puglia, M., McKinney, A. M., Jang, H., Dai, R., Picton, P., Mashour, G. A., & Hudetz, A. G. (2026). An open fMRI resource for studying human brain function and covert consciousness under anesthesia. *Scientific Data*, *13*\(1), Article 127. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-025-06442-2

Traditional Assessment Challenge
---------------------------------

Consider a patient under sedation:

* **Doctor asks**: "If you can hear me, squeeze my hand"
* **Patient's response**: No hand movement, no behavioral sign
* **Standard conclusion**: Patient is unconscious

But what if their brain is actually processing the command and they're consciously following mental imagery instructions, just unable to produce a motor response?

This dissociation between **neural awareness** and **behavioral responsiveness** is covert consciousness.


Why This Matters
----------------

**Clinical Significance:**

1. **Anesthesia Awareness**: Detecting hidden consciousness during surgery when patients appear adequately sedated
2. **Disorders of Consciousness**: Identifying cognitive function in patients with severe brain injury who cannot communicate
3. **Minimally Conscious State**: Distinguishing between vegetative state and minimal consciousness
4. **Personalized Medicine**: Tailoring sedation levels based on neural rather than purely behavioral indicators

**Real-World Impact:**

* **Preventing intraoperative awareness** - a traumatic experience where patients recall surgery
* **Improving prognosis** - correctly identifying consciousness in non-responsive patients
* **Ethical decision-making** - informing care decisions for patients with disorders of consciousness
* **Optimizing recovery** - adjusting treatments based on neural markers



Our Solution
------------

This project implements **deep learning models** to automate consciousness detection from fMRI data, building on the scientific foundations laid by the Michigan team.

**What We Provide:**

* **Automated classification** of consciousness states
* **Cross-subject generalization** using neural networks
* **Interpretable predictions** with attention mechanisms
* **Production-ready code** for deployment
* **Extensible framework** for new models and analyses


Approach Overview
=================

Our machine learning pipeline transforms fMRI brain scans into automated consciousness predictions:

1. **Input**: fMRI data from the Michigan Human Anesthesia Dataset (26 subjects under propofol sedation)
2. **Feature Extraction**: Extract connectivity patterns and network metrics from brain activity
3. **Classification**: Train machine learning models to predict conscious vs. unconscious states
4. **Output**: Automated consciousness detection

Scientific Foundation
---------------------

This project **builds upon** the neuroscience established by:

**Huang, Hudetz, Mashour et al.** at University of Michigan

Key publication:

- **Huang et al. (2018)** - *Scientific Reports*

  *"Brain imaging reveals covert consciousness during behavioral unresponsiveness induced by propofol"*

  * Discovered covert consciousness in 19% of subjects
  * Identified anterior insula as key region
  * Established mental imagery paradigm
