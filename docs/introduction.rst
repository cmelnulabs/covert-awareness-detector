What is Covert Consciousness?
==============================

**Covert consciousness** (also called *covert awareness* or *hidden consciousness*) is a phenomenon where patients show neural signatures of awareness and can follow mental commands, yet exhibit **no behavioral response** - appearing completely unresponsive to external observers.

Traditional Assessment Challenge
---------------------------------

Consider a patient under sedation:

* **Doctor asks**: "If you can hear me, squeeze my hand"
* **Patient's response**: No hand movement, no behavioral sign
* **Standard conclusion**: Patient is unconscious

But what if their brain is actually processing the command and they're consciously following mental imagery instructions, just unable to produce a motor response?

This dissociation between **neural awareness** and **behavioral responsiveness** is covert consciousness - first systematically characterized by Huang, Hudetz, Mashour and colleagues at the University of Michigan (2018).

.. note::
   **Key Insight from Huang et al. (2018)**: Out of 26 healthy volunteers under propofol sedation, **5 subjects (19%)** showed clear brain activation patterns during mental imagery tasks (imagining playing tennis, spatial navigation) despite showing **zero behavioral response** when asked to squeeze a hand.

Why This Matters
----------------

**Clinical Significance:**

1. **Anesthesia Awareness**: Detecting hidden consciousness during surgery when patients appear adequately sedated
2. **Disorders of Consciousness**: Identifying cognitive function in patients with severe brain injury who cannot communicate
3. **Minimally Conscious State**: Distinguishing between vegetative state and minimal consciousness
4. **Personalized Medicine**: Tailoring sedation levels based on neural rather than purely behavioral indicators

**Real-World Impact:**

* **Preventing intraoperative awareness** - a traumatic experience where patients recall surgery
* **Improving prognosis** - correctly identifying consciousness in non-responsive patients
* **Ethical decision-making** - informing care decisions for patients with disorders of consciousness
* **Optimizing recovery** - adjusting treatments based on neural markers


The Problem This Project Solves
================================

Current Limitations
-------------------

**Manual Analysis Challenges:**

The groundbreaking research by Huang et al. established the scientific foundation through careful manual analysis of fMRI data:

* **Time-intensive**: Each patient requires hours of expert analysis
* **Subjective**: Requires trained neuroscientists to interpret connectivity patterns
* **Not real-time**: Post-hoc analysis, not suitable for clinical monitoring
* **Limited scalability**: Cannot be deployed across hospitals at scale

**Clinical Gap:**

While the neuroscience demonstrates that covert consciousness can be detected, there's no **automated, deployable system** that:

1. Works across different subjects (generalization)
2. Operates in real-time or near-real-time
3. Provides interpretable predictions for clinicians
4. Requires minimal expert supervision

.. warning::
   This is a critical gap: We have the science, but lack the engineering to translate it into clinical practice.


Our Solution
------------

This project implements **deep learning models** to automate consciousness detection from fMRI data, building on the scientific foundations laid by the Michigan team.

**What We Provide:**

* **Automated classification** of consciousness states
* **Cross-subject generalization** using neural networks
* **Interpretable predictions** with attention mechanisms
* **Production-ready code** for deployment
* **Extensible framework** for new models and analyses


Approach Overview
=================

Our machine learning pipeline transforms fMRI brain scans into automated consciousness predictions:

1. **Input**: fMRI data from the Michigan Human Anesthesia Dataset (26 subjects under propofol sedation)
2. **Feature Extraction**: Extract connectivity patterns and network metrics from brain activity
3. **Classification**: Train machine learning models to predict conscious vs. unconscious states
4. **Output**: Automated consciousness detection with interpretability
