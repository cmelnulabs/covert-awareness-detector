Feature Extraction
==================

This document explains how the project extracts meaningful features from
fMRI connectivity matrices for consciousness classification.

What Are We Extracting?
=======================

The input is a **connectivity matrix**: a table where each cell contains a
number representing how strongly two brain regions are synchronised. The
matrix has 446 rows and 446 columns (one per brain region), so there are
roughly 99,000 unique pairs of regions.

Raw connectivity matrices are too large and noisy to feed directly into a
classifier. Feature extraction condenses them into a small set of numbers
that summarise how the brain is organised.


The Key Metric: ISD
====================

The project's central feature is **ISD**, derived from the reference paper's
MATLAB code. It measures the balance between two properties of brain networks:

- **Efficiency**: How easily information can travel between any two brain
  regions. High efficiency means any region can communicate with any other
  region through short paths.

- **Clustering**: How much brain regions form tight local groups where
  neighbours are also connected to each other. High clustering means the
  brain has specialised modules.

The ISD is simply:

::

   ISD = efficiency - clustering

A higher ISD indicates a more integrated brain state, which is associated
with consciousness. Loss of consciousness (e.g. under anaesthesia) reduces
the ISD.


How ISD Is Computed
-------------------

1. **Global signal removal**: The strongest shared pattern across all
   regions is removed from the connectivity matrix. In simpler terms, we
   subtract out background noise that's common to all brain regions, letting
   us focus on the specific connections between pairs of regions.

2. **Multilevel efficiency**: The connectivity matrix is converted into a
   series of binary networks at different thresholds (from very lenient to
   very strict). This means we test how well brain regions communicate at
   multiple sensitivity levels—from only counting the strongest connections
   to including weaker ones. At each level, we measure how efficiently
   information could travel between regions, then average these scores.

3. **Multilevel clustering**: The same thresholding procedure is applied
   to the cleaned matrix (after global signal removal). Here we measure how
   much brain regions cluster into tight local groups where neighbors are
   also connected to each other. We again test at multiple sensitivity 
   levels—looking first at only the strongest connections, then gradually
   including weaker ones—and average all these clustering measurements
   together.

4. **ISD calculation**: The difference between the efficiency and clustering
   values—subtracting clustering from efficiency gives us a single number
   that captures the balance between these two brain organization patterns.


Additional Features
===================

Beyond ISD, the project extracts two other groups of features from each
connectivity matrix.

Graph Metrics
-------------

The connectivity matrix is turned into a network (a graph) by treating
each brain region as a node and each strong enough connection as a link.
From this graph, we compute:

- **Mean degree**: On average, how many connections does each region have?
- **Degree variability**: How much does the number of connections vary
  across regions? (Some regions may be hubs with many connections.)
- **Mean strength**: The average total connection weight per region.
- **Strength variability**: How much connection strength varies across
  regions.
- **Density**: What fraction of all possible connections actually exist?

Statistical Summary
-------------------

Basic statistics computed over all pairwise connectivity values:

- Mean, standard deviation, median
- Skewness (is the distribution of connection strengths symmetric or
  lopsided?)
- Kurtosis (does the distribution have heavy tails — are there extreme
  values?)
- Percentiles (25th, 75th) and min/max values

These numbers give a quick profile of the overall connectivity
distribution.


Putting It All Together
=======================

For each brain scan, the feature extraction produces a small dictionary:

- 3 ISD-related values (ISD, efficiency, clustering)
- 5 graph metrics
- 9 statistical summaries
- Optionally, the full set of ~99,000 pairwise connectivity values

In practice, the classifier uses the compact set of 17 features. The
full connectivity vector is available but is high-dimensional and
requires dimensionality reduction (e.g. PCA) before use.

.. code-block:: python

   from src.features import extract_all_features

   features = extract_all_features(connectivity_matrix)
   print(features['isd'])         # ISD metric
   print(features['efficiency'])  # Multilevel efficiency
   print(features['clustering'])  # Multilevel clustering
